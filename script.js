    "A meaty rice dish, plov comes in more than 60 varieties and is one of Uzbek cuisine's most beloved staples. These days, it's usually made by layering up a base of eggs, flour, butter and yogurt with steamed long grain rice, then adding toppings like meat, dried fruit, fresh herbs, fish, vegetables and spices. However, in its most basic form, plov is simply rice with onions, carrots and a meat like mutton or lamb – and its history can be traced back more than 1,000 years. Traditionally prepared for special occasions, plov is often cooked in a large, wide pan called a kazán over an open flame, allowing the ingredients to infuse together in perfect harmony. Each region of Uzbekistan has its own variation of plov, showcasing the diversity and regional flavors of the dish.",
